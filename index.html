Hey there! I am Suraj Samaga. I am a grad student in the EE department at Caltech. I did my undergrad in EE at IIT Bombay.

My academic summary can be found in my <a href="/assets/iitb/suraj_grad_cv.pdf">CV</a>.<br>
The <a href="courses">Courses</a> section houses a list of courses that I have credited at IITB, along with my reviews for a few of them.
