Hey there! I am Suraj Samaga. I am currently in my senior year at the <a href="https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web">Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at IIT Bombay, India.

This website houses any personal as well as professional content relating to me.<br>
My academic summary can be found in my <a href="/assets/iitb/suraj_grad_cv.pdf">CV</a>.<br>
The <a href="courses">Courses</a> section houses a list of courses that I have credited, along with my reviews for a few of them.
